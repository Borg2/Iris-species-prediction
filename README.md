# Iris-species-prediction

### **Introduction**

This repository contains a neural network model developed using PyTorch for classifying iris species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on the classic Iris dataset, a widely used benchmark for machine learning tasks.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples from three species of iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Each sample includes the following features:

* **sepal_length:** Length of the sepal in centimeters.
* **sepal_width:** Width of the sepal in centimeters.
* **petal_length:** Length of the petal in centimeters.
* **petal_width:** Width of the petal in centimeters.

### **Model Architecture**

The neural network model is a [specify the architecture, e.g., sequential model with hidden layers, dropout, activation functions, etc.]. The model is trained using [specify optimization algorithm, loss function, and metrics].

### **Usage**

1. **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
2. **Prepare data:** Load the Iris dataset and preprocess it as needed (e.g., normalize features, create training and testing sets).
3. **Train the model:** Run the training script to train the model on the prepared dataset.
4. **Evaluate performance:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
